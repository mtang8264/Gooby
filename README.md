Gooby

This is a midterm project made by Michael Poltronieri Tang.
The game is designed to be played using a PS4 controller.
All assets are original creations of Michael Poltronieri Tang unless listed below.

The goal in Gooby is to reach the bowl shaped goal.
The move you can use the left stick to roll Gooby in any direction.
The main mechanic is using Gooby's hand to swing and climb.
Using the right stick you can extend Gooby's hand.
If the Gooby's hand is touching a platform you can press the right trigger to grab the platform.
While you are holding the right trigger, you will see a "ghost hand". 
This hand allows you to see where you can reach while still holding onto a platform.
If you are holding onto a platform using the right trigger and the ghost hand is touching a platform you can press the left bumper to switch your hand with the ghost hand.
While you are holding onto a platform you can also press the triangle button to shorten Gooby's arm or the circle button to extend it.
